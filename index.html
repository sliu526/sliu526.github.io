                <p>Hey! I'm Sammy, a third-year at Brown University concentrating in Applied Math and Computer Science from Acton, Massachusetts.
                    Professionally, I'm primarily searching for software engineering internships for Summer 2025, with a special interest in
                    full-stack web development or topics in machine learning. As a developer for Full Stack @ Brown, I have extensive experience
                    working with tech stacks for full-stack web development, specifically with React and Node.js applications, and programming
                    languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, and HTML/CSS. Besides that, this past semester I've been focusing on 
                    finding ways to get involved in my community. For the past few months, I've been volunteering at Brown's Housing
                    Opportunities for Everyone (HOPE) outreach division, distributing food, water, and supplies to the local unhoused population.
                    Looking forward, I hope to see the homeless crisis declared as a public health emergency in the city of Providence.
